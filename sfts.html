  <h2>Bevy Maco - sfts</h2>

<h3>Design Concept</h3>
<p>One of my favorite songs released in 2017 was Bevy Maco's sfts, and as a personal project I wanted to make a visualizer of it before the year ended. The song is fairly athmospheric, and I wanted to create a somewhat melancholy mood with the overall color scheme, which also having the actual music reaction be attention-grabbing. </p>

<h3>Software Used</h3>
<p>The software I used to achieve this look is <a href="https://windmillart.net/?p=jsplacement">JSplacement</a>, Trapcode, and Adobe After Effects.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>I had discovered JSPlacement at the time, a software that generated random displacement maps, and wanted to see if I could use it with Trapcode to create some sort of 3D displacement. I ended up using it with Trapcode Mir, which allowed me to expand a plane with the displacement upwards, creating a cool glow effect. The growth react to the bass of the song through Trapcode Soundkeys, and the intensity of the glow also changes based on the general amplitude. I also added some slow moving particles to the background of the plane to add some depth.</p>
