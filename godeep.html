  <h2>BRLLNT - Go Deep</h2>

<h3>Design Concept</h3>
<p>This was one of the first music visualizers I had ever made. I wanted to make something that would help me get started in figuring out how Trapcode Soundkeys worked. I picked this song since it has a fair amount of contrast and has plenty of different sounds to react to. There wasn't a particular design style I was going for, but I was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTKmDGZlo2Y">Shaped Studios's tutorial</a> on Soundkeys to make something more abstract.</p>

<h3>Software Used</h3>
<p>The software I used to achieve this look is purely Trapcode and Adobe After Effects.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>I first created an abstract object using Trapcode Tao, then made it somewhat trancelucent, then set it to spin and deform based on the bass drum in the song. I also added a light source close to the object to have it stand out from the background. After that, I added a patterned background using Trapcode Mir and set it to react to the general vocal range. I also added another source of light in the background and set it to the same ranges as the Mir object.</p>
