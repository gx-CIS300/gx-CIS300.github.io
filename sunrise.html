  <h2>18 Carat Affair - Sunrise</h2>

<h3>Design Concept</h3>
<p>For this visualizer, I wanted to make something that was in the style of vaporwave/outrun visuals. One of the most popular motifs in outrun is the sun, so I decided to incorporate that into my design. Another popular element used is the grid, which I also decided to add to this visualizer.</p>

<h3>Software Used</h3>
<p>The software I used to achieve this look is purely Trapcode and Adobe After Effects.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>I first created the grid in After Effects using the grid plug-in, then keyframed it so it moved across the space. I then turned the object into a 3D one and used that feature to adjust the perspective on the object. I then drew a sphere using After Effects' built in shape function, and placed a glow on both the circle and the grid to create a more dreamy athmosphere. I then used Trapcode Tao to create a large 3D shape out of some random lines I drew. I animated the amplitude and frequency to create an intersting kind of movement and placed it in the middle of the grid, for more depth sense. Finally, I added a VHS filter on top of the whole visualizer to futher the retro look. </p>
