  <h2>NtrlTaste - Gloss</h2>

<h3>Design Concept</h3>
<p>For this visualizer, I wanted to challenge myself to make something in Cinema 4D specifically. I really wanted to find ways to emulate an "organic space rock" sort of movement and evolution. A song I discovered during this time as well was NtrlTaste's Gloss, and I decided to use it as a base for the reaction, since the song features some short pauses between the synth notes.</p>

<h3>Software Used</h3>
<p>The software I used to achieve this look is purely Cinema 4D.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>I first created a simple object that rotated in Cinema 4D, then applied a material for displacement. For the material, I added an inner glow that I timed the color changes to. I wanted the color to change drastically when the beat dropped in the song, so I started out with a cool blue color then switched the color to a yellow-orange. For the actual music detection and reaction, I used the built-in Xpresso system in Cinema 4D, which allowed me to create <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o60mCtDxvt4">expressions for the amplitude of the song</a>. I then used the amplitude to change the size of the object. For a final touch, I also added some ambient lights around the object that changed color subtly during the song.</p>
