  <h2>Jeebanoff - If You</h2>

<h3>Design Concept</h3>
<p>For this visualizer, I wanted to make something that was minimalistic in its presentation and how it interacted with the music. I picked one of my favorite songs from 2017 by Jeebanoff and decided to use the bass kick as the source of reaction in this one. Since I had been experimenting with Trapcode Mir for water effects, I decided to take part of it and place it in a frame to focus on the movement. I also used the three channel color split for the music reaction, since it looked interesting combined with the details of the generated water.</p>

<h3>Software Used</h3>
<p>The software I used to achieve this look is purely Trapcode and Adobe After Effects.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>I first created the water in Trapcode Mir as a more flowy, almost river like structure, but after messing with the settings a little, I realized instead of bending it together, having it as a flat plain also looked interesting and added to the minimalistic effect. I then precomposed the water layer and added a frame on top. The frame is all black to kind of contrast the details in the water. I then added a color channel effect on top to add some subtle color to the overall design, and synced it with Trapcode Soundkeys so that it shifted ever time the bass kick was detected. </p>
